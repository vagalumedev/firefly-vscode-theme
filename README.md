This theme is based on [Sarah Drasner's Night Owl](https://aka.ms/nightowl) and modified to be branded by Vagalume Digital's colors.

A Visual Studio Code theme for the fireflies out there. Fine-tuned for those of us who like to code late into the night. Color choices have taken into consideration what is accessible to people with colorblindness and in low-light circumstances. Decisions were also based on meaningful contrast for reading comprehension and for optimal razzle dazzle. âœ¨

# Installation

1.  Install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
2.  Launch Visual Studio Code
3.  Choose **Extensions** from menu
4.  Search for `firefly`
5.  Click **Install** to install it
6.  Click **Reload** to reload the Code
7.  From the menu bar click: Code > Preferences > Color Theme > **Firefly**

## Disable Italics

If you wish to disable italics, there is now a no-italic theme available. You will have access to both, select **Firefly No Italics** as your color theme.

## Preferences shown in the preview

The font in the preview image is Fira Code, [available here](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Fira+Code). Editor settings to activate font ligatures:

```
"editor.fontFamily": "Fira Code",
"editor.fontLigatures": true,
```

The preview image is using [Bracket Pair Colorizer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=CoenraadS.bracket-pair-colorizer), a really cool extension that highlights matching brackets. This can help reduce unwanted errors.

I use this setting:

```
"bracketPairColorizer.forceIterationColorCycle": true,
```
